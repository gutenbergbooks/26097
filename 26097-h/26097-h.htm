<p class="pnn"><span class="dc3">T</span><i>HE Discourse which I
now offer to the Publick was drawn up on a very sorrowful Occasion;
the Death of a most desirable Child, who was formed in such a
Correspondence to my own Relish and Temper, as to be able to give
me a Degree of Delight, and consequently of Distress, which I did
not before think it possible I could have received from a little
Creature who had not quite compleated her Fifth Year.</i></p>
<p class="pin"><i>Since the Sermon was preached, it has pleased</i>
G<span class="sc">od</span> <i>to make the like Breaches on the
Families of several of my Friends; and, with Regard to some of
them, the Affliction hath been attended with Circumstances of yet
sorer Aggravation. Tho&rsquo; several of them are removed to a
considerable Distance from me, and from each other I have born
their Afflictions upon my Heart with cordial Sympathy; and it is
with a particular Desire of serving them, that I have undertaken
the sad Task of reviewing and transcribing these Papers; which may
almost be called the Minutes of my own Sighs and Tears, over the
poor Remains of my eldest and (of this Kind) dearest Hope, when
they were not as yet</i> buried out of my Sight.</p>
<p class="pin"><i>They are, indeed, full of Affection, and to be
sure some may think they are too full of it: But let them consider
the Subject, and the Circumstances, and surely they will pardon it.
I apprehend, I could not have treated such a Subject coldly, had I
writ upon it many years ago, when I was untaught in the School of
Affliction, and knew nothing of such a Calamity as this, but by
Speculation or Report: How much less could I do it, when</i>
G<span class="sc">od</span> <i>had touched me in so tender a Part,
and (to allude to a celebrated ancient Story,) called me out to
appear on a publick Stage, as with an Urn in my Hand, which
contained the Ashes of my own Child!</i></p>
<p class="pin"><i>In such a sad Situation Parents, at least, will
forgive the Tears of a Parent, and those Meltings of Soul which
overflow in the following Pages. I have not attempted to run
thro&rsquo; the Common place of</i> immoderate Grief, <i>but have
only selected a few obvious Thoughts which I found peculiarly
suitable to myself; and, I bless</i> G<span class="sc">od</span>,
<i>I can truly say, they gave me a solid and substantial Relief,
under a Shock of Sorrow, which would otherwise have broken my
Spirits.</i></p>
<p class="pin"><i>On my own Experience, therefore, I would
recommend them to others, in the like Condition, And let me intreat
my Friends and Fellow-Sufferers to remember, that it is not a low
Degree of Submission to the Divine Will, which is called for in the
ensuing Discourse. It is comparatively an easy Thing to behave with
external Decency, to refrain from bold Censures and outragious
Complaints, or to speak in the outward Language of Resignation. But
it is not, so easy to get rid of every repining Thought, and to
forbear taking it, in some Degree at least, unkindly, that the</i>
G<span class="sc">od</span> <i>whom we love and serve, in whose
Friendship we have long trusted and rejoiced, should act what, to
Sense, seems so unfriendly a Part: That he should take away a
Child; and if a Child,</i> that Child; <i>and if that Child, at
that Age; and if at that Age, with this or that particular
Circumstance, which seems the very Contrivance of Providence to add
double Anguish to the Wound; and all this, when he could so easily
have recalled it; when we know him to have done it for so many
others; when we so earnestly desired it; when we sought it with
such Importunity, and yet, as we imagine, with so much Submission
too:&mdash;That, notwithstanding all this; he should tear it away
with an inexorable Hand, and leave us, it may be for a while, under
the Load, without any extraordinary Comforts and Supports, to
balance so grievous a Tryal.&mdash;In these Circumstances, not only
to justify, but to glorify</i> G<span class="sc">od</span> <i>in
all,&mdash;chearfully to subscribe to his Will,&mdash;cordially to
approve it as merciful and gracious,&mdash;so as to be able to say,
as the pious and excellent Archbishop of</i> Cambray <i>did, when
his Royal Pupil, and the Hopes of a Nation were taken
away</i><sup><a href="#rpvcr" id="fpvcr" title="see footnote" name=
"fpvcr">&dagger;</a></sup> , &ldquo;<i>If there needed no more than
to move a Straw to bring him to Life again, I would not do it,
since the Divine Pleasure is otherwise&rdquo;.&mdash;This, this is
a difficult Lesson indeed; a Triumph of Christian Faith and Love,
which I fear many of us are yet to learn.</i></p>
<p class="pin"><i>But let us follow after it, and watch against the
first Rising of a contrary Temper, as most injurious to</i>
G<span class="sc">od</span>, <i>and prejudicial to ourselves. To
preserve us against it, let us review the Considerations now to be
proposed, as what we are to digest into our Hearts, and work into
our Thoughts and our Passions. And I would hope, that if we do in
good earnest make the Attempt, we shall find this Discourse a
cooling and sweetening Medicine, which may allay that inward Heat
and Sharpness, with which, in a Case like ours, the Heart is often
inflamed and corroded. I commend it, such as it is, to the Blessing
of the great Physician, and could wish the Reader to make up its
many Deficiencies, by Mr.</i> Flavel&rsquo;s Token for Mourners,
<i>and Dr.</i> Grosvenor&rsquo;s Mourner; <i>to which, if it suit
his Relish, he may please to add Sir</i> William Temple&rsquo;s
Essay on the Excess of Grief: <i>Three Tracts which, in their very
different Strains and Styles, I cannot but look upon as in the
Number of the best which our Language, or, perhaps, any other, has
produced upon this Subject.</i></p>
<p class="pis"><i>As for this little Piece of mine, I question not,
but, like the Generality of single Sermons, it will soon be worn
out and forgot. But in the mean time, I would humbly hope, that
some tender Parent, whom Providence has joined with me in sad
Similitude of Grief, may find some Consolation from it, while
sitting by the Coffin of a beloved Child, or mourning over its
Grave. And I particularly hope it, with Regard to those dear and
valuable Friends, whose Sorrows, on the like Occasion, have lately
been added to my own. I desire that, tho&rsquo; they be not
expressly named, they would please to consider this Sermon as most
affectionately and respectfully</i> dedicated to them; <i>and
would, in Return, give me a Share in their Prayers, that all the
Vicissitudes of Life may concur to quicken me in the Duties of it,
and to ripen me for that blessed World, where I hope many of those
dear Delights, which are now withering around us, will spring up in
fairer and more durable Forms.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Amen.</p>

<p class="pis"><i>I could easily shew, with how much Propriety I
have called the dear Deceased</i> an amiable and hopeful Child,
<i>by a great many little Stories, which Parents would perhaps read
with Pleasure, and Children might hear with some Improvement: Yet
as I cannot be sure that no others may happen to read the
Discourse, I dare not trust my Pen and my Heart, on so delicate a
Subject. One Circumstance I will however venture to mention, (as I
see here is a Blank Page left,) which may indeed be
consider&rsquo;d as a Specimen of many others. As she was a great
Darling with most of our Friends that knew her, she often received
Invitations to different Places at the same Time; and when I once
asked her, on such an Occasion, what made every Body love her so
well; she answer&rsquo;d me, (with that Simplicity and Spirit,
which alas! Charm&rsquo;d me too much,</i>) Indeed, Pappa, I cannot
think, unless it be because I love every Body. <i>A Sentiment
obvious to the Understanding of a Child, yet not unworthy the
Reflection of the wisest Man</i><sup><a href="#rpviii" id="fpviii"

<p class="ph1"><i>And it came to pass when the Man of GOD saw her
afar off, that he said to Gehazi his Servant, Behold, yonder is
that Shunamite: Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto
her, Is it well with thee? Is it well with thine Husband? Is it
well with the Child? And she answered,</i> I<span class="sc1">t is
well.</span></p>
<p class="pnn"><span class="dc4">W</span>HEN the Apostle would
encourage our Hope and Trust in the Tenderness of Christ as the
great High Priest and convince us that he is capable of being
touched with a sympathetick Sense of our Infirmities, he argues at
large from this Consideration, that Jesus <i>was in all Points
tempted like us;</i> so that as <i>he himself has suffer'd, being
tempted, he knows how</i> more compassionately <i>to succour</i>
those that are under the like Trials<sup><a href="#rp1a" id="fp1a"
title="see footnote" name="fp1a">a</a></sup>. Now this must surely
intimate, that it is not in human Nature, even in its most perfect
State, so tenderly to commiserate any Sorrows, as those which our
own Hearts have felt: As we cannot form a perfect Idea of any
bitter Kind of Draught, by the most exact Description, till we have
ourselves tasted it. It is probably for this Reason, amongst
others, that G<span class="sc">od</span> frequently exercises such,
as have the Honour to be inferior Shepherds in the Flock of Christ,
with a long Train of various Afflictions, <i>that we may be able to
comfort them who are in</i> the like <i>Trouble, with those
Consolations with which we have ourselves been comforted of
GOD</i><sup><a href="#rp2b" id="fp2b" title="see footnote" name=
"fp2b">b</a></sup> . And, if we have the Temper which becomes our
Office, it will greatly reconcile us to our Trials, to consider,
that from our weeping Eyes, and our bleeding Hearts, a Balm may be
extracted to heal the Sorrows of others, and a Cordial to revive
their fainting Spirits. May we never be left to sink under our
Burden, in such a manner, that there should be room, after all that
we have boasted of the Strength of religious Supports, to apply to
us the Words of <i>Eliphaz</i> to <i>Job</i><sup><a href="#rp2c"
id="fp2c" title="see footnote" name="fp2c">c</a></sup>, <i>Thou
hast strengthen&rsquo;d the weak Hands, and upheld him that was
ready to fall; but now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it
touches thee, and thou art troubled!</i> May we never behave, as if
<i>the Consolations of GOD</i> were <i>small</i><sup><a href=
"#rp2d" id="fp2d" title="see footnote" name="fp2d">d</a></sup>;
lest it should be <i>as when a Standard-Bearer
fainteth</i><sup><a href="#rp2e" id="fp2e" title="see footnote"
name="fp2e">e</a></sup> , and whole Companies of Soldiers are
thrown into Confusion and Distress!</p>
<p class="pin">M<span class="sc">y</span> Friends, you are
Witnesses for me, that I have not stood by as an unconcerned
Spectator amidst the Desolations of your respective Families, when
G<span class="sc">od</span>&rsquo;s awful Hand hath been lopping
off those tender Branches from them, which were once our common
Hope and Delight. I have often put my Soul in the stead of yours,
and endeavour&rsquo;d to give such a Turn to my publick as well as
my private Discourses, as might be a means of composing and
chearing your Minds, and forming you to a submissive Temper, that
you might <i>be subject to the Father of Spirits, and
live</i><sup><a href="#rp2f" id="fp2f" title="see footnote" name=
"fp2f">f</a></sup> . In this View I have, at different Times,
largely insisted on the Example of <i>Aaron, who held his
peace</i><sup><a href="#rp2g" id="fp2g" title="see footnote" name=
"fp2g">g</a></sup> , when his two eldest Sons were struck dead in a
Moment by Fire from the Lord, which destroyed them in the very Act
of their Sin; and I have also represented that of <i>Job,</i> who,
when the Death of ten Children by one Blow was added to the Spoil
of his great Possessions, could say, <i>The Lord gave, and the Lord
hath taken away; blessed be the Name of the Lord</i><sup><a href=
"#rp3h" id="fp3h" title="see footnote" name="fp3h">h</a></sup>. The
Instance which is here before us, is not indeed so memorable as
these; but to present Circumstances it is, in many Respects, more
suitable: And it may the rather deserve our Notice, as it shews us
the Wisdom, Composure, and Piety of one of the weaker and tenderer
Sex, on an Occasion of such aggravated Distress, that had
<i>Aaron</i> or <i>Job</i> behaved just as she did, we must have
acknowledged, that they had not sunk beneath the Dignity of their
Character, nor appear&rsquo;d unworthy of our Applause, and our
Imitation.</p>
<p class="pin">I<span class="sc">ndeed</span> there may be some
Reason to imagine, that it was with Design to humble those who are
in distinguish&rsquo;d Stations of Life, and who have peculiar
Advantages and Obligations to excel in Religion, that G<span class=
"sc">od</span> has shewn us in Scripture, as well as in common
Life, some bright Examples of Piety, where they could hardly have
been expected in so great a Degree; and hath, as it were,
<i>perfected Praise out of the Mouths of Babes and
Sucklings</i><sup><a href="#rp3i" id="fp3i" title="see footnote"
name="fp3i">i</a></sup> . Thus when <i>Zacharias</i><sup><a href=
"#rp3k" id="fp3k" title="see footnote" name="fp3k">k</a></sup>, an
aged Priest, doubted the Veracity of the Angel which appeared to
assure him of the Birth of his Child, which was to be produced in
an ordinary Way; <i>Mary,</i> an obscure young Virgin, could
believe a far more unexampled Event, and said, with humble Faith
and thankful Consent, <i>Behold the Hand-maid of the Lord, be it
unto me according to thy Word</i><sup><a href="#rp3l" id="fp3l"
title="see footnote" name="fp3l">l</a></sup>. <i>Jonah</i> the
Prophet, tho&rsquo; favour&rsquo;d with such immediate Revelations,
and so lately delivered, in a miraculous Way, from the very
<i>Belly of Hell</i><sup><a href="#rp4m" id="fp4m" title=
"see footnote" name="fp4m">m</a></sup>, was thrown into a most
indecent Transport of Passion, on the withering of a Gourd; so that
he presumed to tell the Almighty to his Face, that <i>he did well
to be angry even unto Death</i><sup><a href="#rp4n" id="fp4n"
title="see footnote" name="fp4n">n</a></sup>: Whereas this pious
Woman preserves the Calmness and Serenity of her Temper, when she
had lost a Child, a Son, an only Child, who had been given beyond
all natural Hope, and therefore to be sure was so much the dearer,
and the Expectation from him so much the higher. Yet are these
Expectations dash&rsquo;d almost in a Moment; and this, when he was
grown up to an Age when Children are peculiarly entertaining; for
he was old enough to be with his Father in the Field, where no
doubt he was diverting him with his fond Prattle; yet he was not
too big to be laid <i>on his Mother&rsquo;s Knees</i><sup><a href=
"#rp4o" id="fp4o" title="see footnote" name="fp4o">o</a></sup>,
when he came home complaining of his Head; so that he was probably
about five or six Years old. This amiable Child was well in the
Morning, and dead by Noon; a pale Corpse in his Mother&rsquo;s
Arms! and he now <i>lay dead in the House</i>; and yet they had the
Faith, and the Goodness to say, &ldquo;<i>It is
well.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pin">T<span class="sc">his</span> good Woman had found
the Prophet <i>Elisha</i> grateful for all the Favours he had
received at her House; where she had from time to time accommodated
him in his Journies, and thought it an Honour rather than an
Incumbrance. She had experienced the Power of his Prayers, in
answer to which the Child had been given; and &rsquo;tis extremely
probable, that she also recollected the Miracle which <i>Elijah</i>
had wrought a few Years before, tho&rsquo; till that Time the like
had not been known in <i>Israel</i>, or on Earth; I mean, in
raising from the Dead the Child of that Widow of
<i>Sarepta</i><sup><a href="#rp5p" id="fp5p" title="see footnote"
name="fp5p">p</a></sup> , who had nourished him during the Famine.
She might therefore think it a possible Case, that the Miracle
might be renewed; at least, she knew not how to comfort herself
better, than by going to so good a Friend, and asking his Counsels
and his Prayers, to enable her to bear her Affliction, if it must
not be removed<sup><a href="#rp5as" id="fp5as" title="see footnote"
name="fp5as">*</a></sup> ,</p>
<p class="pin">A<span class="sc">ccordingly</span> she hasted to
him; and he, on the other side, discovered the Temper of a real
Friend, in the Message with which he sent <i>Gehazi</i> his Servant
to meet her, <i>while she was yet afar off.</i> The Moment she
appeared, the Concerns of her whole Family seem to have come into
his kind Heart at once, and he particularly asks, <i>Is it well
with thee? Is it well with thine Husband? Is it well with the
Child?</i> A beautiful Example of that affectionate Care for the
Persons and Families of their Friends, which Christian Ministers
(who, like the Prophets of old, are called <i>Men of G<span class=
"sc">od</span></i><sup><a href="#rp5q" id="fp5q" title=
"see footnote" name="fp5q">q</a></sup>) should habitually bear
about in their Hearts; which should be awakened by every Sight of
them, and expressed on every proper Occasion.</p>
<p class="pin">H<span class="sc">er</span> Answer was very
remarkable: <i>She said, It is well.</i> Perhaps she meant this, to
divert the more particular Enquiry of the Servant; as she had
before made the same Answer to her Husband, when he had examined
into the Reason of her intended Journey, as probably not knowing of
the sad Breach which had been made: <i>She said, It is
well</i><sup><a href="#rp5r" id="fp5r" title="see footnote" name=
"fp5r">r</a></sup> ; which was a civil way of intimating her Desire
that he would not ask any more particular Questions. But I cannot
see any Reason to restrain the Words to this Meaning alone: We have
ground to believe, from the Piety she expressed in her first
Regards to <i>Elisha,</i> and the Opportunities which she had of
improving in Religion by the frequent Converse of that holy Man,
that when she used this Language, she intended thereby to express
her Resignation to the Divine Will in what had lately pass&rsquo;d:
And this might be the Meaning of her Heart, (tho&rsquo; one
ignorant of the Particulars of her Case, might not fully understand
it from such ambiguous Words; ) &ldquo;<i>It is well</i> on the
whole. Though my Family be afflicted, we are afflicted in
Faithfulness; tho&rsquo; my dear Babe be dead, yet my Heavenly
Father is just, and he is good in all. He knows how to bring Glory
to himself, and Advantage to us, from this Stroke. Whether this
Application do, or do not succeed, whether the Child be, or be not
restored, <i>it is</i> still <i>well</i>; <i>well</i> with him, and
<i>well</i> with us; for we are in such wise and such gracious
Hands, that I would not allow one murmuring Word, or one repining
Thought.&rdquo; So that, on the whole, the Sentiment of this good
<i>Shunamite</i> was much the same with that of <i>Hezekiah</i>,
when he answered to that dreadful Threatning which imported the
Destruction of his Children, <i>Good is the Word of the Lord which
he hath spoken</i><sup><a href="#rp6s" id="fp6s" title=
"see footnote" name="fp6s">s</a></sup>; or that of <i>Job</i>, when
he heard that all his Sons and his Daughters were crushed under the
Ruins of their elder Brother&rsquo;s House, and yet (in the
fore-cited Words) <i>blessed the Name of the Lord.</i></p>
<p class="pin">Now this is the Temper to which, by divine
Assistance, we should all labour to bring our own Hearts, when
G<span class="sc">od</span> puts this bitter Cup into our Hands,
and <i>takes away with a Stroke</i> those dear Little-ones, which
were the <i>Desire of our Eyes</i><sup><a href="#rp6t" id="fp6t"
title="see footnote" name="fp6t">t</a></sup>, and the Joy of our
Hearts. Let us not content ourselves, in such Circumstances, with
<i>keeping the Door of our Lips</i><sup><a href="#rp6u" id="fp6u"
title="see footnote" name="fp6u">u</a></sup>, that we break not out
into any Indecencies of Complaint; let us not attempt to harden
ourselves against our Sorrows by a stern Insensibility, or that
sullen Resolution which sometimes says, <i>It is a Grief, and I
must bear it</i><sup><a href="#rp7w" id="fp7w" title="see footnote"
name="fp7w">w</a></sup> ; but let us labour, (for <i>a great
Labour</i> it will indeed be,) to compose and quiet our Souls,
calmly to acquiesce in this painful Dispensation, nay, cordially to
approve it as in present Circumstances every Way fit.</p>
<p class="pis">I<span class="sc">t</span> will be the main Business
of this Discourse, to prove how reasonable such a Temper is, or to
shew how much Cause Christian Parents have to borrow the Language
of the Text, when their Infant Offspring is taken away, and to say
with the pious <i>Shunamite</i>, in the noblest Sense that her
Words will bear,&mdash;<i>It is well.</i></p>
<p class="pin">A<span class="sc">nd</span> here I would more
particularly shew,&mdash;It is well in the general, because
G<span class="sc">od</span> does it:&mdash;It is surely well for
the pious Parents in particular, because it is the Work of their
Covenant G<span class="sc">od</span>:&mdash;They may see many
Respects in which it is evidently so, by observing what useful
Lessons it has a Tendency to teach them:&mdash;And they have Reason
to hope, it is well with those dear Creatures whom G<span class=
"sc">od</span> hath removed in their early Days.</p>
<p class="pis">T<span class="sc">hese</span> are surely convincing
Reasons to the Understanding: Yet who can say, that they shalt be
Reasons to the Heart? <i>Arise, O G<span class="sc">od</span>, and
plead thine own Cause</i><sup><a href="#rp7x" id="fp7x" title=
"see footnote" name="fp7x">x</a></sup> in the most effectual
Manner! May thy powerful and gracious Voice appease the swelling
Billows of the Passions, and produce a great and delightful Calm in
our Souls, in which we may yet enjoy thee and ourselves, tho&rsquo;
a Part of our Treasure be for the present swallowed up!</p>
<a id="I" name="I"></a>
<p class="ph2">I. T<span class="sc">here</span> is surely Reason,
in such a Case, to say <i>it is well</i>,&mdash;because
G<span class="sc">od</span> doth it.</p>
<p class="pin">T<span class="sc">his</span> pass&rsquo;d for an
unanswerable Reason with <i>David, I was dumb, I opened not my
Mouth, because thou didst it</i><sup><a href="#rp8y" id="fp8y"
title="see footnote" name="fp8y">y</a></sup>, and with good old
<i>Eli,</i> under a severer Tryal than ours, <i>It is the Lord, let
him do as seemeth good in his Sight</i><sup><a href="#rp8z" id=
"fp8z" title="see footnote" name="fp8z">z</a></sup>. And shall We
object against the Force of it? Was it a Reason to <i>David</i>,
and to <i>Eli</i>, and is it not equally so to us? Or have We any
new Right to <i>reply against G<span class=
"sc">od</span></i><sup><a href="#rp8a" id="fp8a" title=
"see footnote" name="fp8a">a</a></sup>, which those eminent Saints
had not?</p>
<p class="pis"><i>His kingdom ruleth over all</i><sup><a href=
"#rp8b" id="fp8b" title="see footnote" name="fp8b">b</a></sup>; and
there is <i>not</i> so much as <i>a Sparrow that falls to the
Ground without our Father, but the very Hairs of our Head are all
number&rsquo;d</i><sup><a href="#rp8c" id="fp8c" title=
"see footnote" name="fp8c">c</a></sup> by him. Can we then imagine
that our dear Children fall into their Graves without his Notice or
Interposition? Did that watchful Eye that <i>keepeth Israel</i>,
now, for the first time, <i>slumber and sleep</i><sup><a href=
"#rp8d" id="fp8d" title="see footnote" name="fp8d">d</a></sup>, and
an Enemy lay hold on that fatal Moment to bear away these precious
Spoils, and bury our Joys and our Hopes in the Dust? Did some
malignant Hand stop up the Avenues of Life, and break its Springs,
so as to baffle all the Tenderness of the Parent, and all the Skill
of the Physician? Whence does such a Thought come, and whither
would it lead? Diseases and Accidents are but second Causes, which
owe all their Operations to the continued Energy of the great
original Cause. Therefore G<span class="sc">od</span> says, <i>I
will bereave them of Children</i><sup><a href="#rp8e" id="fp8e"
title="see footnote" name="fp8e">e</a></sup>; <i>I take away the
Desire of thine Eyes with a Stroke</i><sup><a href="#rp8f" id=
"fp8f" title="see footnote" name="fp8f">f</a></sup><i>. He changeth
their Countenance, and sendeth them away</i><sup><a href="#rp8g"
id="fp8g" title="see footnote" name="fp8g">g</a></sup>. <i>Thou
Lord turnest Man to Destruction, and sayest, Return ye Children of
Men</i><sup><a href="#rp9h" id="fp9h" title="see footnote" name=
"fp9h">h</a></sup> . And what shall we say? Are not the
Administrations of his Providence wise and good? Can we <i>teach
him Knowledge</i><sup><a href="#rp9i" id="fp9i" title=
"see footnote" name="fp9i">i</a></sup>? Can we tax him with
Injustice? Shall the Most High G<span class="sc">od</span> learn of
us how to govern the World, and be instructed by our Wisdom when to
remove his Creatures from one State of Being to another? Or do we
imagine that his Administration, in the general Right and Good,
varies when he comes to <i>touch our Bone and our
Flesh</i><sup><a href="#rp9k" id="fp9k" title="see footnote" name=
"fp9k">k</a></sup> <i>?</i> Is that the secret Language of our
Soul, &ldquo;That <i>it is well</i>, others should drink of the
Cup, but not We; that any Families but ours should be broken, and
any Hearts but ours should be wounded?&rdquo; Who might not claim
the like Exemption? and what would become of the Divine Government
in general; or where would be his obedient Homage from his
Creatures, if each should begin to complain, as soon as it comes to
his own Turn to suffer? Much fitter is it for us to conclude, that
our own Afflictions may be as reasonable as those of others; that
amidst all the <i>Clouds and Darkness</i> of this present
Dispensation, <i>Righteousness and Judgment are the Habitation of
his Throne</i><sup><a href="#rp9l" id="fp9l" title="see footnote"
name="fp9l">l</a></sup> ; and, in a word, that <i>it is well</i>,
because G<span class="sc">od</span> hath done it. It suits the
general Scheme of the Divine Providence, and to an obedient
submissive Creature that might be enough; but it is far from being
all. For,</p>
<a id="II" name="II"></a>
<p class="ph2">II. P<span class="sc">ious</span> P<span class=
"sc">arents</span>, under such a Dispensation, may conclude <i>it
is well for them</i> in particular,&mdash;because he, who hath done
it, is their Covenant G<span class="sc">od</span>.</p>
<p class="pin">T<span class="sc">his</span> is the great Promise,
to which all the Saints under the Old and New Testament are Heirs,
<i>I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a
People</i><sup><a href="#rp10m" id="fp10m" title="see footnote"
name="fp10m">m</a></sup> : And if we are interested in it, the
happy Consequence is, that we being his, all our Concerns are his
also; all are humbly resigned to him,&mdash;and graciously
administer&rsquo;d by him,&mdash;and incomparably better Blessings
bestowed and secured, than any which the most afflictive Providence
can remove.</p>
<p class="pin">I<span class="sc">f</span> we have any Share in this
everlasting Covenant, all that we are or have, must, of course,
have been <i>solemnly surrender&rsquo;d</i> to G<span class=
"sc">od</span>. And this is a Thought peculiarly applicable to the
Case immediately in view. &ldquo;Did I not,&rdquo; may the
Christian, in such a sad Circumstance, generally say, &ldquo;did I
not, in a very solemn Manner, bring this my Child to God in
Baptism, and in that Ordinance recognize his Right to it? Did I
not, with all humble <i>Subjection to the Father of
Spirits</i><sup><a href="#rp10n" id="fp10n" title="see footnote"
name="fp10n">n</a></sup> , and <i>Father of
Mercies</i><sup><a href="#rp10o" id="fp10o" title="see footnote"
name="fp10o">o</a></sup>, lay it down at his Feet, perhaps with an
express, at least to be sure with a tacit Consent, that it should
be disposed of by him, as his infinite Wisdom and Goodness should
direct, whether for Life or for Death? And am I now to complain of
him, because he has removed not only a Creature of his own, but one
of the Children of his Family? Or shall I pretend, after all, to
set up a Claim in Opposition to his? A Heathen Parent, even from
the Light of Nature, might have learn&rsquo;d silent Submission:
How much more then a Christian Parent, who hath presented his Child
to G<span class="sc">od</span> in this initiatory Ordinance; and
perhaps also many a time, both before and since, hath presented
himself at the Table of the Lord! Have I not there taken that
<i>Cup of Blessings</i>, with a declared Resolution of accepting
every other <i>Cup</i> how bitter soever it might be, <i>which my
heavenly Father</i> should see fit to <i>put into my
Hand</i><sup><a href="#rp11p" id="fp11p" title="see footnote" name=
"fp11p">p</a></sup>? When I have perhaps felt some painful
Fore-bodings of what I am now suffering; I have, in my own
Thoughts, particularly singled out that dear Object of my Cares and
my Hopes, to lay it down anew at my Father&rsquo;s Feet, and say,
<i>Lord thou gavest it to me, and I resign it to thee; continue, or
remove it, as thou pleasest.</i> And did I then mean to trifle with
G<span class="sc">od</span>? Did I mean in effect to say, <i>Lord,
I will give it up, if thou wilt not take it?&rdquo;</i></p>
<p class="pin">R<span class="sc">eflect</span> farther, I beseech
you, on your <i>secret Retirements</i>, and think, as surely some
of you may, &ldquo;How often have I there been on my Knees before
G<span class="sc">od</span> on account of this Child; and what was
then my Language? Did I say, Lord, I absolutely insist on its
Recovery; I cannot, on any Terms or any Considerations whatsoever,
bear to think of losing it?&rdquo; Sure we were none of us so
indecently transported with the fondest Passion, as to be so
<i>rash with our Mouths</i> as <i>to utter</i> such <i>Things
before</i> the Great G<span class="sc">od</span><sup><a href=
"#rp11q" id="fp11q" title="see footnote" name="fp11q">q</a></sup>.
Such Presumption had deserv&rsquo;d a much heavier Punishment than
we are now bearing, and, if not retracted, may perhaps still have
it.&mdash;Did not one or another of us rather say, &ldquo;Lord, I
would humbly intreat, with all due Submission to thy superior
Wisdom and sovereign Pleasure, that my Child may live; but if it
must be otherwise, <i>not my Will, but thine be
done</i><sup><a href="#rp11r" id="fp11r" title="see footnote" name=
"fp11r">r</a></sup> ? I and mine are in thine Hand, <i>do with
me</i>, and with them, <i>as seemeth good in thy
Sight</i><sup><a href="#rp11s" id="fp11s" title="see footnote"
name="fp11s">s</a></sup> &rdquo;. And do we now blame ourselves for
this? Would we unsay it again, and, if possible, take ourselves and
our Children out of his Hands, whom we have so often owned as
all-wise and all-gracious, and have chosen as our great Guardian
and theirs?</p>
<p class="pin">L<span class="sc">et</span> it farther be
consider&rsquo;d, it is done by that G<span class="sc">od</span>
who has <i>accepted of this Surrender</i>, so as to undertake the
Administration of our Affairs: &ldquo;He is become my Covenant
G<span class="sc">od</span> in Christ,&rdquo; may the Christian
say; &ldquo;and, in consequence of that Covenant, he hath engaged
to manage the Concerns and Interests of his People so, that <i>all
Things shall work together for good to them that love
him</i><sup><a href="#rp12t" id="fp12t" title="see footnote" name=
"fp12t">t</a></sup> : And do I not love him? Answer, Oh my Heart,
dost thou not love thy G<span class="sc">od</span> much better than
all the Blessings which Earth can boast, or which the Grave hath
swallowed up? Wouldst thou resign thine Interest in him to recover
these precious Spoils, to receive this dear Child from the Dust, a
thousand times fairer and sweeter than before? Rather let Death
devour every remaining Comfort, and leave me alone with him; with
whom when I indeed am, I miss not the Creatures, but rather rejoice
in their Absence, as I am then more intire with <i>him whom my Soul
loveth.</i> And if I do indeed love him, this Promise is mine, and
<i>all Things</i>, and therefore this sad Event in particular,
<i>shall work together for my good.</i> Shall I not then say, <i>It
is well?</i> What if it exceeded all the Stretch of my Thoughts, to
conceive <i>how</i> it could, in any Instance, be so? What are my
narrow Conceptions, that they should pretend to circumscribe
infinite Wisdom, Faithfulness, and Mercy? Let me rather, with
<i>Abraham, give Glory to God, and in Hope believe against
Hope</i><sup><a href="#rp12u" id="fp12u" title="see footnote" name=
"fp12u">u</a></sup> &rdquo;.</p>
<p class="pis">O<span class="sc">nce</span> more; let us consider
how many <i>invaluable Blessings</i> are given us by this Covenant,
and then judge whether we have not the utmost Reason to acquiesce
in such an Event of Providence. &ldquo;If I am in Covenant with
God,&rdquo; may the Believer say, &ldquo;then he hath pardoned my
Sins, and renewed my Heart, and hath made his blessed Spirit
dwelling in me, the sacred Bond of an everlasting Union between him
and my Soul. He is leading me through the Wilderness, and will, ere
long, lead me out of it to the heavenly <i>Canaan</i>. And how far
am I already arrived in my Journey thither, now that I am come to
the Age of losing a Child! And when G<span class="sc">od</span>
hath done all this for me, is he rashly to be suspected of
Unkindness? <i>He that spared not his own Son</i><sup><a href=
"#rp12w" id="fp12w" title="see footnote" name="fp12w">w</a></sup>,
he that gave me with him his Spirit and his Kingdom, why doth he
deny, or why doth he remove, any other Favour? Did he think the
Life of this Child too great a Good to grant, when he thought not
Christ and Glory too precious? Away with that Thought, Oh my
unbelieving Heart, and with every Thought which would derogate from
such rich amazing Grace, or would bring any thing in comparison
with it. Art thou under these Obligations to him, and wilt thou yet
complain? With what Grace, with what Decency canst thou dispute
this, or any other Matter, with thy G<span class="sc">od</span>?
<i>What Right have I yet to cry any more to the
King?</i><sup><a href="#rp12x" id="fp12x" title="see footnote"
name="fp12x">x</a></sup> &rdquo; Would any of you, my Brethren,
venture to say, &ldquo;What tho&rsquo; I be a Child of
G<span class="sc">od</span>, and an Heir of Glory, it matters not,
for <i>my Gourd is withered</i>; that pleasant Plant which was
opening so fair and so delightful, under the Shadow of which I
expected long to have sate, and even <i>the Rock of Ages</i> cannot
shelter me so well? I can behold that beloved Face no more, and
therefore I will not look upward to behold the Face of
G<span class="sc">od</span>, I will not look forward to Christ and
to Heaven?&rdquo; Would this, my Friends, be the Language of a real
Christian? Nay, are there not many abandon&rsquo;d Sinners who
would tremble at such Expressions? Yet is it not in effect the
Language of our tumultuous Passions, when, like <i>Rachel,</i> we
are <i>mourning for our Children,</i> and <i>will not be comforted,
because they are not</i><sup><a href="#rp13y" id="fp13y" title=
"see footnote" name="fp13y">y</a></sup>? Is it not our Language
while we cannot, like the pious <i>Shunamite</i> in the Text, bring
our afflicted Hearts to say, <i>It is well?</i></p>
<a id="III" name="III"></a>
<p class="ph2">III. P<span class="sc">ious</span> P<span class=
"sc">arents</span>, in such a Circumstance, have farther Reason to
say, <i>It is well</i>,&mdash;as they may observe an apparent
Tendency in such a Dispensation to teach them a Variety of the most
instructive and useful Lessons, in a very convincing and effectual
Manner.</p>
<p class="pin">&rsquo;T<span class="sc">is</span> a just
Observation of <i>Solomon</i>, that <i>the Rod and Reproof give
Wisdom</i><sup><a href="#rp13z" id="fp13z" title="see footnote"
name="fp13z">z</a></sup> ; and &rsquo;tis peculiarly applicable to
such a Chastisement of our heavenly Father. It should therefore be
our great Care to <i>bear the Rod and him that hath appointed
it</i><sup><a href="#rp13a" id="fp13a" title="see footnote" name=
"fp13a">a</a></sup> ; and so far as it hath a Tendency to teach us
our Duty, and to improve the divine Life in our Souls, we have the
highest Reason to say, that <i>it is</i> indeed <i>well.</i></p>
<p class="pin">E<span class="sc">very</span> Affliction hath in its
Degree this kind of Tendency, and &rsquo;tis the very Reason for
which <i>we are</i> thus <i>chastened</i>, that we may
<i>profit</i> by our Sorrows, and be made <i>Partakers of
God&rsquo;s Holiness</i><sup><a href="#rp15b" id="fp15b" title=
"see footnote" name="fp15b">b</a></sup>. But this Dispensation is
peculiarly adapted, in a very affecting Manner,&mdash;to teach us
the Vanity of the World,&mdash;to warn us of the Approach of our
own Death,&mdash;to quicken us in the Duties incumbent upon us,
especially to our surviving Children,&mdash;and to produce a more
intire Resignation to the Divine Will, which is indeed the surest
Foundation of Quiet, and Source of Happiness.</p>
<p class="pis"><span class="sc">shall</span> insist a little more
particularly on each of these; and I desire that it may be
remembered, that the Sight and Knowledge of such mournful
Providences as are now before us, should, in some Degree, be
improved to these Purposes, even by those Parents whose Families
are most prosperous and joyful: May they learn Wisdom and Piety
from what <i>we</i> suffer, and their Improvements shall be
acknowledged as an additional Reason for <i>us</i> to say, <i>It is
well.</i></p>
<a id="III1" name="III1"></a>
<p class="ph2">1. W<span class="sc">hen</span> G<span class=
"sc">od</span> takes away our Children from us, it is a very
affecting Lesson of the Vanity of the World.</p>
<p class="pis">T<span class="sc">here</span> is hardly a Child born
into it, on whom the Parents do not look with some pleasing
Expectation that it shall <i>comfort them concerning their
Labour</i><sup><a href="#rp15c" id="fp15c" title="see footnote"
name="fp15c">c</a></sup> . This makes the Toil of Education easy
and delightful: And truly &rsquo;tis very early that we begin to
find a Sweetness in it, which abundantly repays all the Fatigue.
Five, or four, or three, or two Years, make Discoveries which
afford immediate Pleasure, and which suggest future Hopes. Their
Words, their Actions, their very Looks touch us, if they be amiable
and promising Children, in a tender, but very powerful Manner;
their little Arms twine about our Hearts; and there is something
more penetrating in their first broken Accents of Indearment, than
in all the Pomp and Ornament of Words. Every Infant-Year increases
the Pleasure, and nourishes the Hope. And where is the Parent so
wise and so cautious, and so constantly intent on his Journey to
Heaven, as not to measure back a few Steps to Earth again, on such
a plausible and decent Occasion, as that of introducing the young
Stranger into the Amusements, nay perhaps, where Circumstances will
admit it, into the Elegancies of Life, as well as its more serious
and important Business? What fond Calculations do we form of what
it <i>will be</i>, from what <i>it is</i>! How do we in Thought
open every Blossom of Sprightliness, or Humanity, or Piety, to its
full Spread, and ripen it to a sudden Maturity! But, oh, who shall
teach those that have never felt it, how it tears the very Soul;
when G<span class="sc">od</span> roots up the tender Plant with an
inexorable Hand, and withers the Bud in which the Colours were
beginning to glow! Where is now our Delight? Where is our Hope? Is
it in the Coffin? Is it in the Grave? Alas! all the Loveliness of
Person, of Genius, and of Temper, serves but to point and to poison
the Arrow, which is drawn out of our own Quiver to wound us. Vain,
delusive, transitory Joys! &ldquo;And such, Oh my Soul,&rdquo; will
the Christian say, &ldquo;such are thine earthly Comforts in every
Child, in every Relative, in every Possession of Life; such are the
Objects of thy Hopes, and thy Fears, thy Schemes, and thy Labours,
where Earth alone is concerned. Let me then, once for all, direct
mine Eyes to another and a better State. From these <i>broken
Cisterns</i>, the Fragments of which may hurt me indeed, but can no
longer refresh me, let me look to the <i>Fountain of living
Waters</i><sup><a href="#rp17d" id="fp17d" title="see footnote"
name="fp17d">d</a></sup> . From these setting, Stars, or rather
these bright but vanishing Meteors, which make my Darkness so much
the more sensible, let me turn to the <i>Father of Lights.</i> Oh
Lord, <i>What wait I for? my Hope is in thee</i><sup><a href=
"#rp17e" id="fp17e" title="see footnote" name="fp17e">e</a></sup>,
my Pure Abode, my everlasting Confidence! My Gourds wither, my
Children die; but <i>the Lord liveth, and blessed be my Rock, and
let the God of my Salvation be exalted</i><sup><a href="#rp17f" id=
"fp17f" title="see footnote" name="fp17f">f</a></sup>. I see, in
one Instance more, the sad Effects of having over-loved the
Creature; let me endeavour for the future, by the Divine
Assistance, to fix my Affections there where they cannot exceed;
but where all the Ardor of them will be as much my Security and my
Happiness, as it is now my Snare and my Distress.&rdquo;</p>
<a id="III2" name="III2"></a>
<p class="ph2">2. T<span class="sc">he</span> Removal of our
Children by such awful Strokes may warn us of the Approach of our
own Death.</p>
<p class="pis">H<span class="sc">ereby</span> G<span class=
"sc">od</span> doth very sensibly shew us, and those around us,
that <i>all Flesh is as Grass, and all the Glory</i> and Loveliness
<i>of it like the Flower of the Field</i><sup><a href="#rp17g" id=
"fp17g" title="see footnote" name="fp17g">g</a></sup>. And when our
own Habitations are made the Houses of Mourning, and ourselves the
Leaders in that sad Procession, it may surely be expected that we
should lay it to Heart, so as to be quicken&rsquo;d and improved by
the View. &ldquo;Have my Children died in the Morning of their
Days, and can I promise myself that I shall see the Evening of
mine? Now perhaps may I say, in a more literal Sense than ever,
<i>The Graves are ready for me</i><sup><a href="#rp17h" id="fp17h"
title="see footnote" name="fp17h">h</a></sup>. One of my Family,
and some of us may add, the First-born of it, is gone as it were to
take Possession of the Sepulchre in all our Names; and ere long I
shall lie down with my Child in the same Bed; yea perhaps many of
the Feet that followed it shall attend me thither. Our Dust shortly
shall be blended together; and who can tell but this Providence
might chiefly be intended as a Warning Blow to me, that these
concluding Days of my Life might be more regular, more spiritual,
more useful than the former?&rdquo;</p>
<a id="III3" name="III3"></a>
<p class="ph2">3. T<span class="sc">he</span> Providence before us
may be farther improved to quicken us in the Duties of Life, and
especially in the Education of surviving Children.</p>
<p class="pin">I<span class="sc">t</span> is, on the Principles I
hinted above, an Engagement, that <i>whatever our Hand findeth to
do, we should do it with all our Might</i>, since it so plainly
shews us that we are <i>going to the Grave, where there is no
Device, nor Knowledge, nor Working</i><sup><a href="#rp18j" id=
"fp18j" title="see footnote" name="fp18j">j</a></sup>: But permit
me especially to observe, how peculiarly the Sentiments we feel on
these sad Occasions, may be improved for the Advantage of our dear
Offspring who yet remain, and quicken us to a proper Care in their
religious Education.</p>
<p class="pin">We all see that it is a very reasonable Duty, and
every Christian Parent resolves that he will <i>ere long</i> apply
himself to it; but I am afraid, great Advantages are lost by a
Delay, which we think we can easily excuse. Our Hands are full of a
Variety of Affairs, and our Children are yet very young: We are
therefore ready to imagine &rsquo;tis a good Husbandry of Time to
defer our Attempts for their Instruction to a more <i>convenient
Season</i><sup><a href="#rp18k" id="fp18k" title="see footnote"
name="fp18k">k</a></sup> , when they may be able to learn more in
an Hour, than the Labour of Days could now teach them; besides that
we are apprehensive of Danger in over-loading their tender Spirits,
especially when they are perhaps under Indisposition, and need to
be diverted, rather than gravely advised and instructed.</p>
<p class="pin">B<span class="sc">ut</span> I beseech you, my
Friends, let us view the Matter with that Impartiality, which the
Eloquence of Death hath a Tendency to produce. &ldquo;That lovely
Creature that G<span class="sc">od</span> hath now taken away,
tho&rsquo; its Days were few, tho&rsquo; its Faculties were weak,
yet might it not have known a great deal more of Religion than it
did, and felt a great deal more of it too, had I faithfully and
prudently done my Part? How did it learn Language so soon, and in
such a Compass and Readiness? Not by multiplied Rules, nor
labour&rsquo;d Instruction, but by Conversation. And might it not
have learn&rsquo;d much more of Divine Things by Conversation too,
if they had been allowed a due Share in our Thoughts and our
Discourses; according to the Charge given to the <i>Israelites</i>,
to <i>talk of them going out and coming in, lying down and rising
up</i><sup><a href="#rp19l" id="fp19l" title="see footnote" name=
"fp19l">l</a></sup> ? How soon did it learn Trifles, and retain
them, and after its little way observe and reason upon them,
perhaps with a Vivacity that sometimes surprized me! And had I been
as diligent as I ought, who can tell what Progress it might have
made in Divine Knowledge? Who can tell but, as a Reward to these
pious Cares, G<span class="sc">od</span> might have put a Word into
its dying Lips, which I might all my Life have recollected with
Pleasure, and <i>out of its</i> feeble <i>Mouth might have
perfected Praise</i><sup><a href="#rp19m" id="fp19m" title=
"see footnote" name="fp19m">m</a></sup>?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pis">M<span class="sc">y</span> Friends, let us humble
ourselves deeply before G<span class="sc">od</span> under a Sense
of our past Neglects, and let us learn our future Duty. We may
perhaps be ready fondly to say, &ldquo;Oh that it were possible my
Child could be restored to me again, tho&rsquo; it were but for a
few Weeks or Days! how diligently would I attempt to supply my
former Deficiencies!&rdquo; Unprofitable Wish! Yet may the Thought
be improved for the good of surviving Children. How shall we
express our Affection to them? Not surely by indulging all the
Demands of Appetite and Fancy, in many early Instances so
hazardous, and so fatal; not by a Solicitude to treasure up Wealth
for them, whose only Portion may perhaps be a little Coffin and
Shrowd. No; our truest Kindness to them will be to endeavour, by
Divine Grace, to form them to an early Inquiry after G<span class=
"sc">od</span>, and Christ, and Heaven, and a Love for real
Goodness in all the Forms of it which may come within their
Observation and Notice. Let us apply ourselves immediately to this
Talk, as those that remember there is a double Uncertainty, in
their Lives, and in ours. In a Word, let us be <i>that</i> with
regard to every Child that yet remains, which we proposed and
engaged to be to that which is taken away, when we pleaded with
G<span class="sc">od</span> for the Continuance of its Life, at
least for a little while, that it might be farther assisted in the
Preparations for Death and Eternity. If such Resolutions be formed
and pursued, the Death of one may be the Means of spiritual Life to
many; and we shall surely have Reason to say <i>it is well</i>, if
it teach us so useful a Lesson.</p>
<a id="III4" name="III4"></a>
<p class="ph2">4. T<span class="sc">he</span> Providence before us
may have a special Tendency to improve our Resignation to the
Divine Will; and if it does so, it will indeed be <i>well</i>.</p>
<p class="pin">T<span class="sc">here</span> is surely no
imaginable Situation of Mind so sweet and so reasonable, as that
which we feel, when we humbly refer ourselves in all Things to the
Divine Disposal, in an intire Suspension of our own Will, seeing
and owning the Hand of G<span class="sc">od</span>, and bowing
before it with a filial Acquiescence. This is chiefly to be
learn&rsquo;d from suffering; and perhaps there is no Suffering
which is fitter to teach it, than this. In many other Afflictions
there is such a Mixture of human Interposition, that we are ready
to imagine, we may be allowed to complain, and to chide a little.
Indignation mingles itself with our Grief; and when it does so, it
warms the Mind, tho&rsquo; with a feverish Kind of Heat, and in an
unnatural Flow of Spirits, leads the Heart into a Forgetfulness of
G<span class="sc">od</span>. But here it is so apparently his Hand,
that we must refer it to him, and it will appear bold Impiety to
quarrel at what is done. In other Instances we can at least flatter
ourselves with Hope, that the Calamity may be diverted, or the
Enjoyment recovered; but here alas! there is no Hope. &ldquo;Tears
will not,&rdquo; as <sup><a href="#rp21as" id="fp21as" title=
"see footnote" name="fp21as">*</a></sup>Sir <i>William Temple</i>
finely expresses it, &ldquo;water the lovely Plant so as to cause
it to grow again; Sighs will not give it new Breath, nor can we
furnish it with Life and Spirits by the Waste of our own.&rdquo;
The Sentence is finally gone forth, and the last fatal Stroke
irrecoverably given. Opposition is vain; a forced Submission gives
but little Rest to the Mind; a cordial Acquiescence in the Divine
Will is the only thing in the whole World that can ease the
labouring Heart, and restore true Serenity. Remaining Corruption
will work on such an Occasion, and a painful Struggle will convince
the Christian how imperfect his present Attainments are: And this
will probably lead him to an attentive Review of the great Reasons
for Submission; it will lead him to urge them on his own Soul, and
to plead them with G<span class="sc">od</span> in Prayer; till at
length the Storm is laid, and <i>Tribulation worketh Patience, and
Patience Experience, and Experience a Hope which maketh not
ashamed,</i> while <i>the Love of God is so shed abroad in the
Heart</i><sup><a href="#rp22n" id="fp22n" title="see footnote"
name="fp22n">n</a></sup>, as to humble it for every preceding
Opposition, and to bring it even to a real Approbation of all that
so wise and good a Friend hath done; resigning every other Interest
and Enjoyment to his Disposal, and fitting do with the sweet
Resolution of the Prophet, <i>Tho&rsquo; the Fig-tree do not
blossom, and there be no Fruit in the Vine, &amp;c. yet will I
rejoice in the Lord, and joy in the God of my
Salvation</i><sup><a href="#rp22o" id="fp22o" title="see footnote"
name="fp22o">o</a></sup>. And when we are brought to this, the
whole Horizon clears, and the Sun breaks forth in its Strength.</p>
<p class="pis">N<span class="sc">ow</span> I appeal to every
sincere Christian in the Assembly, whether there will not be Reason
indeed to say <i>it is well</i>, if by this painful Affliction we
more sensibly learn the Vanity of the Creature and we are awakened
to serious Thoughts of our own latter End; if by it we are quickned
in the Duties of Life, and formed to a more intire Resignation of
Soul, and Acquiescence in the Divine Will. I shall only add once
more, and &rsquo;tis a Thought of delightful Importance,</p>
<a id="IV" name="IV"></a>
<p class="ph2">IV. T<span class="sc">hat</span> pious Parents have
Reason to hope <i>it is well</i> with those dear Creatures who are
taken away in their early Days.</p>
<p class="pin">I <span class="sc">see</span> not that the Word of
G<span class="sc">od</span> hath any whit passed a damnatory
Sentence on any Infants; and it has not, I am sure we have no
Authority to doubt, especially considering with how much Compassion
the Divine Being speaks of them in the Instance of the
<i>Ninevites</i><sup><a href="#rp22p" id="fp22p" title=
"see footnote" name="fp22p">p</a></sup>, and on some other
Occasions. Perhaps, as some pious Divines have conjectured, they
may constitute a very considerable Part of Number of the Elect,
and, <i>as in Adam</i> they <i>all died</i>, they may <i>in Christ
all be made alive</i><sup><a href="#rp23q" id="fp23q" title=
"see footnote" name="fp23q">q</a></sup>. At least, methinks, from
the Covenant which G<span class="sc">od</span> made with
<i>Abraham</i>, and his Seed, <i>the Blessings of which</i> are
<i>come upon the</i> believing <i>Gentiles</i><sup><a href="#rp23r"
id="fp23r" title="see footnote" name="fp23r">r</a></sup>, there is
Reason to hope well concerning the Infant Offspring of
G<span class="sc">od</span>&rsquo;S People, early devoted, and
often recommended to him, that their <i>Souls</i> will be <i>bound
in the Bundle of Life</i><sup><a href="#rp23s" id="fp23s" title=
"see footnote" name="fp23s">s</a></sup>, and <i>be loved for their
Parents Sakes</i><sup><a href="#rp23t" id="fp23t" title=
"see footnote" name="fp23t">t</a></sup>.</p>
<p class="pin">I<span class="sc">t</span> is, indeed, impossible
for us to say, how soon Children may be capable of contracting
personal Guilt. They are quickly able to distinguish, some Degree,
between Right and Wrong; and &rsquo;tis too plain, that they as
quickly, in many Instances, forget the Distinction. The Corruptions
of Nature begin early to work, and shew the Need of sanctifying
Grace; yet, without a Miracle, it cannot be expected that much of
the Christian Scheme should be understood by these little
Creatures, in the first dawning of Reason, tho&rsquo; a few
evangelical Phrases may be taught, and, sometimes, by a happy kind
of Accident, may be rightly applied. The tender Heart of a Parent
may, perhaps, take a Hint, from hence to terrify itself, and
exasperate all its other Sorrows, by that sad Thought, &ldquo;What
if my dear Child be perished for ever? gone from our Embraces, and
all the little Pleasures we could give it, to everlasting Darkness
and Pain?&rdquo; Horrible Imagination! And Satan may, perhaps, take
the Advantage of these gloomy Moments, to aggravate every little
Infirmity into a Crime, and to throw us into an Agony, which no
other View of the Affliction can possibly give, to a Soul
penetrated with a Sense of Eternity. Nor do I know a Thought, in
the whole Compass of Nature, that hath a more powerful Tendency to
produce suspicious Notions of G<span class="sc">od</span>, and a
secret Alienation of Heart from him.</p>
<p class="pin">N<span class="sc">ow</span> for this very Reason,
methinks, we should guard against so harsh a Conclusion, lest we,
at once, injure the Divine Being, and torture ourselves. And,
surely, we may easily fall on some Reflections which may incourage
our Hopes, where <i>little Children</i> are concerned; and
&rsquo;tis only of that Case that I am now speaking. Let us think
of the blessed G<span class="sc">od</span>, as the great Parent of
universal Nature; whose <i>tender Mercies are over all his
Works</i><sup><a href="#rp24t" id="fp24t" title="see footnote"
name="fp24t">t</a></sup>; who declares that Judgment is <i>his
strange Work</i><sup><a href="#rp24u" id="fp24u" title=
"see footnote" name="fp24u">u</a></sup>; who <i>is very pitiful,
and of tender Mercy</i><sup><a href="#rp24w" id="fp24w" title=
"see footnote" name="fp24w">w</a></sup>, <i>gracious and full of
Compassion</i><sup><a href="#rp24x" id="fp24x" title="see footnote"
name="fp24x">x</a></sup>; who <i>delighteth in
Mercy</i><sup><a href="#rp24y" id="fp24y" title="see footnote"
name="fp24y">y</a></sup>; who <i>waiteth to be
gracious</i><sup><a href="#rp24z" id="fp24z" title="see footnote"
name="fp24z">z</a></sup>; and <i>endureth, with much
Long-suffering,</i> even <i>the Vessels of Wrath fitted to
Destruction</i><sup><a href="#rp24a" id="fp24a" title=
"see footnote" name="fp24a">a</a></sup>. He intimately <i>knows our
Frame</i><sup><a href="#rp24b" id="fp24b" title="see footnote"
name="fp24b">b</a></sup>, and our Circumstances; he sees the
Weakness of the unformed Mind; how forcibly the volatile Spirits
are struck with a thousand new amusing Objects around it, and born
away as a Feather before the Wind; and, on the other hand, how,
when Distempers seize it, the feeble Powers are over-born in a
Moment, and render&rsquo;d incapable of any Degree of Application
and Attention. And, Lord, wilt thou <i>open thine Eyes on such a
one, to bring</i> it <i>into</i> strict <i>Judgment with
thee</i><sup><a href="#rp24c" id="fp24c" title="see footnote" name=
"fp24c">c</a></sup> ? Amidst all the Instances of thy Patience, and
thy Bounty, to the most abandon&rsquo;d of Mankind, are these
little helpless Creatures the Objects of thy speedy Vengeance, and
final Severity?</p>
<p class="pin">L<span class="sc">et</span> us farther consider, as
it is a very comfortable Thought in these Circumstances, the
compassionate Regard which the blessed <i>Jesus</i> expressed to
little Children. He was <i>much displeased</i> with those who
forbad their being <i>brought</i> to him; <i>and said, Suffer them
to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the Kingdom of
G<span class="sc">od</span></i>; and <i>taking them up in his Arms,
he laid his Hands upon them, and blessed them</i><sup><a href=
"#rp25d" id="fp25d" title="see footnote" name="fp25d">d</a></sup>.
In another Instance we are told, that he <i>took a little
Child</i>, (who appears to have been old enough to come at his
Call,) and <i>set him in the Midst of his Disciples, and said,
Except ye become as little Children, you shall in no wise enter
into the kingdom of Heaven</i><sup><a href="#rp25e" id="fp25e"
title="see footnote" name="fp25e">e</a></sup>. May we not then hope
that many little Children are admitted into it? And may not that
Hope be greatly confirmed from whatever, of an amiable and regular
Disposition, we have observed in those that are taken away? If we
have seen <sup><a href="#rp25cr" id="fp25cr" title="see footnote"
name="fp25cr">&dagger;</a></sup><i>a Tenderness of Conscience in
any thing which they apprehended would displease the great and good
G<span class="sc">od</span>; a Love to Truth; a Readiness to attend
on Divine Worship, from some imperfect Notion of its general
Design, though the Particulars of it could not be understood; an
open, candid, benevolent Heart; a tender Sense of Obligation, and a
Desire, according to their little Power, to repay it</i>; may we
not hope that these were some of the <i>first Fruits of the
Spirit</i><sup><a href="#rp25f" id="fp25f" title="see footnote"
name="fp25f">f</a></sup>, which he would, in due Time, have ripened
into Christian Graces, and are now, on a sudden, perfected by that
great Almighty Agent <i>who worketh all, and in
all</i><sup><a href="#rp25g" id="fp25g" title="see footnote" name=
"fp25g">g</a></sup> ?</p>
<p class="pin">S<span class="sc">ure</span> I am, that this blessed
Spirit hath no inconsiderable Work to perform on the most
established Christians, to finish them to a complete Meetness for
the Heavenly World: Would to G<span class="sc">od</span>, there
were no greater Blemishes to be observed in their Character, than
the little Vanities of Children! With infinite Ease then can he
perfect what is lacking in their unfinished Minds, and pour out
upon them, in a Moment, that Light and Grace, which shall qualify
them for a State, in Comparison of which, ours on Earth is but
Childhood or Infancy.</p>
<p class="pin">N<span class="sc">ow</span> what a noble Source of
Consolation is here! Then may the affectionate Parent say,
&ldquo;<i>It is well</i>, not only with me, but <i>with the
Child</i> too: Incomparably better than if my ardent Wishes, and
importunate Prayers for its Recovery, had been answered. <i>It
is</i> indeed <i>well</i>, if that beloved Creature be <i>fallen
asleep in Christ</i><sup><a href="#rp26h" id="fp26h" title=
"see footnote" name="fp26h">h</a></sup>; if that dear Lamb be
folded in the Arms of the compassionate Shepherd, and gathered into
his gracious Bosom. Self-love might have led me to wish its longer
Continuance here; but if I truly <i>loved</i> my Child with a
solid, rational Affection, I should much rather <i>rejoice</i>, to
think <i>it is gone to</i> a heavenly <i>Father</i><sup><a href=
"#rp26i" id="fp26i" title="see footnote" name="fp26i">i</a></sup>,
and to the World of perfected Spirits above. Had it been spared to
me, how slowly could I have taught it! and in the full Ripeness of
its Age, what had it been, when compared with what it now is! How
is it shot up on a sudden, from the Converse and the Toys of
Children, to be a Companion with Saints and Angels, in the
Employment, and the Blessedness of Heaven! Shall I then complain of
it as a rigorous Severity to my Family, that G<span class=
"sc">od</span> hath taken it to the Family above? And what if he
hath chosen to bestow the distinguished Favour on <i>that one</i>
of my little Flock, who was formed to take the tenderest Hold of my
Heart? Was there Unkindness in that? What if he saw, that the very
Sprightliness and Softness which made it to me so exquisitely
delightful, might, in Time, have betrayed it into Ruin; and took
this Method of sheltering it from Trials which had, otherwise, been
too hard for it, and so fixing a Seal on its Character and
Happiness? What if that strong Attachment of my Heart to it, had
been a Snare to the Child, and to me? Or what if it had been
otherwise? Do I need additional Reasons to justify the Divine
Conduct, in an Instance which my Child is celebrating in the Songs
of Heaven? If it is a new and untasted Affliction to have such a
tender Branch lopp&rsquo;d off, it is also a new Honour to be the
Parent of a glorified Saint.&rdquo; And, as good Mr. <i>Howe</i>
expressed it on another Occasion, &ldquo;<i>If G<span class=
"sc">od</span> be pleased, and his glorified Creature be pleased,
who are we that we should be displeased?&rdquo;</i><sup><a href=
"#rp27as" id="fp27as" title="see footnote" name=
"fp27as">*</a></sup></p>
<p class="pin">&ldquo;Could I wish, that this young Inhabitant of
Heaven should be degraded to Earth again? Or would it thank me for
that With? Would it say, that it was the Part of a wife Parent, to
call it down from a Sphere of finch exalted Services and Pleasures,
to our low Life here upon Earth? Let me rather be thankful for the
pleasing Hope, that tho&rsquo; G<span class="sc">od</span> loves my
Child too well to permit it to return to me, he will ere long bring
me to it. And then that endeared paternal Affection, which would
have been a Cord to tie me to Earth, and have added new Pangs to my
Removal from it, will be asa golden Chain to draw me upwards, and
add one farther Charm and Joy even to Paradise itself.&rdquo; And
oh, how great a Joy to view the Change, and to compare that dear
Idea, so fondly laid up, so often reviewed, with the now glorious
Original, in the Improvements of the upper World! To borrow the
Words of the sacred Writer, in a very different Sense? &ldquo;<i>I
said, I was desolate and bereaved of Children, and who hath brought
up these? I was left alone, and these where have they
been?</i><sup><a href="#rp28k" id="fp28k" title="see footnote"
name="fp28k">k</a></sup> Was this my Desolation? this my Sorrow? to
part with thee for a few Days, <i>that I might receive thee for
Ever</i><sup><a href="#rp28l" id="fp28l" title="see footnote" name=
"fp28l">l</a></sup> , and find thee what thou now art!&rdquo; It is
for no Language, but that of Heaven, to describe the sacred Joy
which such a Meeting must occasion.</p>
<p class="pin">I<span class="sc">n</span> the mean time,
Christians, let us keep up the lively Expectation of it, and let
what has befallen us draw our Thoughts upwards. Perhaps they will
sometimes, before we are aware, sink to the Grave, and dwell in the
Tombs that contain the poor Remains of what was once so dear to us.
But let them take Flight from thence to more noble, more delightful
Scenes. And I will add, let the Hope we have of the Happiness of
our Children render G<span class="sc">od</span> still dearer to our
Souls. We feel a very tender Sense of the Kindness which our
Friends expressed towards them, and think, indeed very justly, that
their affectionate Care for them lays a lasting Obligation upon us.
What Love then, and what Service do we owe to thee, oh gracious
Father, who hast, we hope, received them into thine House above,
and art now entertaining them there with unknown Delight,
tho&rsquo; our former Methods of Commerce with them be cut off!
&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; should each of us say in such a Case, &ldquo;I
would take what thou art doing to my Child as done to my self, and
as a Specimen and Earnest of what shall shortly be done.&rdquo;
<i>It is</i> therefore <i>well</i>.</p>
<p class="pis">I<span class="sc">t</span> only remains, that I
conclude with a few Hints of farther Improvement.</p>
<a id="IV1" name="IV1"></a>
<p class="ph2">1. L<span class="sc">et</span> pious Parents, who
have lost hopeful Children <i>in a maturer Age</i>, join with
others in saying, <i>It is well</i>.</p>
<p class="pin">M<span class="sc">y</span> Friends, the Reasons
which I have been urging at large, are common to you with us; and
permit me to add, that as your Case has its peculiar Distress, it
has, I think, in a yet greater Degree, its peculiar Consolations
too.</p>
<p class="pin">I <span class="sc">know</span> you will say, that it
is inexpressibly grievous and painful, to part with Children who
were grown up into most amiable Friends, who were your Companions
in the Ways of G<span class="sc">od</span>, and concerning whom you
had a most agreeable Prospect, that they would have been the
Ornaments and Supports of Religion in the rising Age, and extensive
Blessings to the World, long after you had quitted it. These
Reasonings have, undoubtedly, their Weight; and they have so, when
considered in a very different View. Must you not acknowledge <i>it
is well</i>, that you enjoyed so many Years of Comfort in them?
that you reaped so much solid Satisfaction from them? and saw those
Evidences of a Work of Grace upon their Hearts, which give you such
abundant Reason to conclude that they are now received to that
Inheritance of Glory, for which they were so apparently <i>made
meet</i>? Some of them, perhaps, had already quitted their
Father&rsquo;s House: As for others, had G<span class=
"sc">od</span> spared their Lives, they might have been
transplanted into Families of their own: And if, instead of being
removed to another House, or Town, or County, they are taken by
G<span class="sc">od</span> into another World, is that a Matter of
so great Complaint; when that World is so much better, and you are
yourselves so near it? I put it to your Hearts, Christians, Would
you rather have chosen to have buried them in their Infancy, or
never to have known the Joys and the Hopes of a Parent, now you
know the Vicissitude of Sorrow, and of Disappointment? But perhaps,
you will say, that you chiefly grieve for that Loss which the World
has sustained by the Removal of those, from whom it might
reasonably have expected so much future Service. This is, indeed, a
generous, and a Christian Sentiment, and there is something noble
in those Tears which flow on such a Consideration. But do not so
remember your Relation to Earth, as to forget that which you bear
to Heaven; and do not so wrong the Divine Wisdom and Goodness, as
to suppose, that when he takes away from hence promising
Instruments of Service, he there lays them by as useless. Much more
reasonable is it to conclude, that their Sphere of Action, as well
as Happiness, is inlarged, and that the Church above hath gained
incomparably more, than that below can be supposed to have lost by
their Death.</p>
<p class="pin">O<span class="sc">n</span> the whole, therefore, far
from complaining of the Divine Conduct in this Respect, it will
become you, my Friends, rather to be very thankful that these dear
Children were spared so long; to accompany and entertain you in so
many Stages of your short Journey thro&rsquo; Life, to answer so
many of your Hopes, and to establish so many more beyond all Fear
of Disappointment. Reflect on all that G<span class="sc">od</span>
did in, and upon them, on all he was beginning to do by them, and
on what you have great Reason to believe he is now doing for them;
and adore his Name, that he has left you these dear Memorials, by
which your Case is so happily distinguished from ours, whose Hopes
in our Children withered in the very Bud; or from theirs, who saw
those who were once so dear to them, perishing, as they have Cause
to fear, <i>in the Paths of the Destroyer.</i></p>
<p class="pis">B<span class="sc">ut</span> while I speak thus,
methinks I am alarmed, lest I should awaken the far more grievous
Sorrows of some mournful Parent, whom it will not be so easy to
comfort. My Brethren and Friends, what shall I say to you, who are
lamenting over your <i>Absaloms</i>, and almost wishing <i>you had
died for them</i><sup><a href="#rp31m" id="fp31m" title=
"see footnote" name="fp31m">m</a></sup>? Shall I urge <i>you</i> to
say <i>it is well?</i> Perhaps you may think it a great Attainment,
if, like <i>Aaron,</i> when his Sons <i>died before the Lord</i>,
you <i>can hold your Peace</i><sup><a href="#rp31n" id="fp31n"
title="see footnote" name="fp31n">n</a></sup>, under the awful
Stroke. My Soul is troubled for you; <i>my Words are</i> almost
<i>swallowed up.</i> I cannot unsay what I have elsewhere said at
large on this melancholy Subject<sup><a href="#rp31as" id="fp31as"
title="see footnote" name="fp31as">*</a></sup>. Yet let me remind
you of this, that you do not certainly know what Almighty Grace
might do for these lamented Creatures, even in the latest Moments,
and have therefore no Warrant confidently to pronounce that they
are assuredly perished. And if you cannot but tremble in the too
probable Fear of it, labour to turn your Eyes from so dark a
Prospect, to those better Hopes which G<span class="sc">od</span>
is setting before <i>you</i>. For surely you still have abundant
Reason to rejoice in that Grace, which gives your own <i>Lives to
you as a Prey</i>, and has brought you so near to that blessed
World, where, hard as it is now to conceive it, you will have laid
aside every Affection of Nature, which interferes with the
Interests of G<span class="sc">od</span>, and prevents your most
chearful Acquiescence in every Particular of his wise and gracious
Determinations.</p>
<a id="IV2" name="IV2"></a>
<p class="ph2">2. F<span class="sc">rom</span> what we have heard,
let us learn not to think of the Loss of our Children with a
slavish Dread.</p>
<p class="pis">I<span class="sc">t</span> is to a Parent indeed
such a cutting Stroke, that I wonder not if Nature shrink back at
the very Mention of it: And, perhaps, it would make those to whom
G<span class="sc">od</span> hath denied Children more easy, if they
knew what some of the happiest Parents feel in an uncertain
Apprehension of the Loss of theirs: An Apprehension which strikes
with peculiar Force on the Mind, when Experience hath taught us the
Anguish of such an Affliction in former Instances. But let us not
anticipate Evils: Perhaps all our Children, who are hitherto
spared, may follow us to the Grave Or, if otherwise, we <i>sorrow
not as those who have no Hope</i><sup><a href="#rp32p" id="fp32p"
title="see footnote" name="fp32p">p</a></sup>. We may have Reason
still to say; <i>It is well</i>, and, thro&rsquo; Divine Grace, we
may also have Hearts to say it. Whatever we lose, if we be the
Children of G<span class="sc">od</span>, we shall never lose our
Heavenly Father, He will still be our Support, and our Joy. And
therefore let us turn all our Anxiety about uncertain, future
Events, into a holy Solicitude to please him, and to promote
religious Impressions in the Hearts of our dear Offspring; that if
G<span class="sc">od</span> should see fit to take them away, we
may have a Claim to the full Consolations, which I have been
representing in the preceding Discourse.</p>
<a id="IV3" name="IV3"></a>
<p class="ph2">3. L<span class="sc">et</span> us not sink in
hopeless Sorrow, or break out into clamorous Complaints, if
G<span class="sc">od</span> has brought this heavy Affliction upon
us.</p>
<p class="pis">A <span class="sc">stupid</span> Indifference would
be absurd and unnatural: G<span class="sc">od</span> and Man might
look upon us as acting a most unworthy Part, should we be like
<i>the Ostrich in the Wilderness, which hardeneth herself against
her young ones, as if they were not hers; because G<span class=
"sc">od</span> hath deprived her of Wisdom, neither hath he
imparted to her Understanding</i><sup><a href="#rp33q" id="fp33q"
title="see footnote" name="fp33q">q</a></sup>. Let us sorrow like
Men, and like Parents; but let us not, in the mean time, forget
that we are Christians. Let us remember how common the Calamity is;
few Parents are exempt from it; some of the most pious and
excellent have lost amiable Children, with Circumstances perhaps of
peculiar Aggravation. &rsquo;Tis a Trial which G<span class=
"sc">od</span> hath chosen for the Exercise of some who have been
eminently dear to him, as we may learn from a Variety of Instances
both ancient and modern. Let us recollect our many Offences against
our heavenly Father, those Sins which such a Dispensation may
properly <i>bring to our Remembrance</i><sup><a href="#rp33r" id=
"fp33r" title="see footnote" name="fp33r">r</a></sup>; and let that
silence us, and teach us to own, that <i>&rsquo;tis of the
Lord&rsquo;s Mercies we are not consumed</i><sup><a href="#rp33s"
id="fp33s" title="see footnote" name="fp33s">s</a></sup>, and that
we are <i>punished less than our Iniquities
deserve</i><sup><a href="#rp33t" id="fp33t" title="see footnote"
name="fp33t">t</a></sup>. Let us look round on our surviving
Comforts; let us look forward to our future, our eternal Hopes; and
we shall surely see, that there is still Room for Praise, still a
Call for it. Let us review the Particulars mentioned above, and
then let Conscience determine whether it doth not become us, in
this particular Instance, to say it steadily, and chearfully too,
Even <i>this is well.</i> And may the G<span class="sc">od</span>
of all Grace and Comfort apply these Considerations to our Mind,
that we may not only own them, but feel them, as a reviving Cordial
when our Heart is overwhelmed within us! In the mean Time, let me
beseech you whose <i>tabernacles are in Peace</i><sup><a href=
"#rp33u" id="fp33u" title="see footnote" name="fp33u">u</a></sup>,
and whose <i>Children are yet about you</i><sup><a href="#rp33w"
id="fp33w" title="see footnote" name="fp33w">w</a></sup>, that you
would not be severe in censuring our Tears, till you have
experimentally known our Sorrows, and yourselves tasted <i>the
Wormwood and the Gall</i>, which we, with all our Comforts, must
have in a long and a bitter <i>Remembrance</i><sup><a href="#rp34x"
id="fp34x" title="see footnote" name="fp34x">x</a></sup>.</p>
<a id="IV4" name="IV4"></a>
<p class="pin">4. L<span class="sc">et</span> those of us who are
under the Rod, be very solicitous to improve it aright, that in the
End it may indeed be <i>well</i>.</p>
<p class="pin">H<span class="sc">ear</span>, my Brethren, my
Friends and Fellow-Sufferers, hear and <i>suffer the word of
Exhortation</i><sup><a href="#rp34y" id="fp34y" title=
"see footnote" name="fp34y">y</a></sup>. Let us be much concerned,
that we may not bear all the Smart of such an Affliction, and,
through our own Folly, lose all that Benefit which might,
otherwise, be a rich Equivalent. In Proportion to the Grievousness
of the Stroke, should be our Care to attend to the Design of it.
Let us, now G<span class="sc">od</span> is calling us to Mourning
and Lamentation, be <i>searching and trying our Ways, that we may
turn again unto the Lord</i><sup><a href="#rp34z" id="fp34z" title=
"see footnote" name="fp34z">z</a></sup>. Let us review the Conduct
of our Lives, and the State and Tenour of our Affections, that we
may observe what hath been deficient, and what irregular; that
proper Remedies may be applied, and those important Lessons more
thoroughly learnt, which I was mentioning under the former Branch
of my Discourse. Let us pray, that through our Tears we may read
our Duty, and that by the Heat of the Furnace we may be so melted,
that our Dross may be purged away, and the Divine Image instamped
on our Souls in brighter and fairer Characters. To sum up all in
one Word, let us endeavour to set our Hearts more on that
G<span class="sc">od</span>, who is infinitely <i>better to us than
ten Children</i><sup><a href="#rp34a" id="fp34a" title=
"see footnote" name="fp34a">a</a></sup>, who hath <i>given us a
Name better than that of Sons or of Daughters</i><sup><a href=
"#rp34b" id="fp34b" title="see footnote" name="fp34b">b</a></sup>,
and can abundantly supply the Place of all earthly Enjoyments with
the rich Communications of his Grace: Nay, perhaps, we may add, who
hath removed some Darling of our Hearts, lest to our infinite
Detriment it should fill his Place there, and, by alienating us
from his Love and Service, have a fatal Influence on our present
Peace, and our future Happiness.</p>
<p class="pis">E<span class="sc">ternal</span> Glory, my Friends,
is so great a Thing, and the compleat Love and Enjoyment of
G<span class="sc">od</span> so unutterably desirable, that it is
well worth our while to bear the sharpest Sorrows, by which we may
be more perfectly formed for it. We may even congratulate the Death
of our Children, if it bring us nearer to our heavenly Father; and
teach us, (instead of filling this Vacancy in our Heart with some
new Vanity, which may shortly renew our Sorrows,) to consecrate the
whole of it to him who alone deserves, and can alone answer the
most intense Affection. Let us try what of this kind may be done.
We are now going to the Table of the Lord<sup><a href="#rp35as" id=
"fp35as" title="see footnote" name="fp35as">*</a></sup>, to that
very Table where our Vows have often been sealed, where our
Comforts have often been reigned, where our <i>Isaac&rsquo;s</i>
have been conditionally sacrificed, and where we commemorate the
real Sacrifice which G<span class="sc">od</span> hath made even of
his only begotten Son for us. May our other Sorrows be suspended,
while we <i>mourn for him whom we have pierced, as for an only Son,
and are in Bitterness as for a First-born</i><sup><a href="#rp35c"
id="fp35c" title="see footnote" name="fp35c">c</a></sup>. From his
Blood Consolations spring up, which will flourish even on the
Graves of our dear Children; and the Sweetness of that Cup which he
there gives us, will temper the most distasteful Ingredients of the
other. Our Houses <i>are not so with G<span class=
"sc">od</span></i>, as they once were, as we once expected they
would have been, but <i>he hath made with us an everlasting
Covenant</i>, and these are the Tokens of it. Blessed be his Name,
we hold not the Mercies of that Covenant by so precarious a Tenure
as the Life of any Creature. <i>It is well ordered in all things
and sure:</i> May <i>it be all our Salvation, and all our
Desire</i><sup><a href="#rp36d" id="fp36d" title="see footnote"
name="fp36d">d</a></sup>; and then it is but a little while, and
all our Complaints will cease. <i>G<span class="sc">od</span> will
wipe away these Tears from our Eyes</i><sup><a href="#rp36e" id=
"fp36e" title="see footnote" name="fp36e">e</a></sup>, our peaceful
and happy Spirits shall ere long meet with those of our Children
which he hath taken to himself. Our Bodies shall sleep, and ere
long also awake, and arise with theirs. <i>Death</i>, that
inexorable Destroyer, <i>shall be swallowed up in
Victory</i><sup><a href="#rp36f" id="fp36f" title="see footnote"
name="fp36f">f</a></sup>, while we and ours surround the Throne
with everlasting Hallelujahs, and own, with another Evidence than
we can now perceive; with another Spirit than we can now express,
that <i>All was indeed well</i>. &nbsp;&nbsp;Amen.</p>
